# Runtime-Terror

This is a game designed for the elementary education level children to practice math. 
They can practice how to do the basic algebra operations by playing the game we made.

Once the game starts, the player can choose which room to go. Every room has several questions to solve. 
We can solve the problems by moving the blocks to the correct locations. 
We are able to know if the answers are correct according to the colors of the blocks.
